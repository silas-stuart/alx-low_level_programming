0x14. C - Bit manipulation:
---------------------------
0. For task 0 you were supposed to create a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int: Arguments
-Prototype: unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);
-where b is pointing to a string of 0 and 1 chars
-Return: the converted number, or 0 if there is one or more chars in the string b that is not 0 or 1 b is NULL

1. I had to Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.
Prototype: void print_binary(unsigned long int n);
